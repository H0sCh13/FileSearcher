# FileSearcher
Simple search program, which allows you to search for specific type of files.

There are currently only 4 kinds of file types available: .txt, .gif., .png and .jpg.

The main directory of the search process is set to C:\ and cannot yet be changed within the program.
Also keep in mind, that the searching can take a while and can only be stopped with ctrl + c.
